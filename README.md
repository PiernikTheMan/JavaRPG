How to play 
You have to have a javac then you just mess with the Player.java file in your favorite text editor , edit: "well is seems the editor have to be able to deal with linux line ecoding i dk how to deal with that"
compile it, run it and watch the results
dont change the Player.java name
don't use the hidden folder it will spoil the fun ;)
folow the story
if you need help just run help.class in JVM
