# JavaRPG

*This is a development branch switch to JavaRPG-shipment-demo branch*

## How to play:

You have to have a javac, then you just mess with the Player.java file in your favorite text editor.

Compile it and watch the results.

* Don't change the Player.java name.
* Don't use the hidden folder it will spoil the fun ;)

If you need help just run help.class in JVM
